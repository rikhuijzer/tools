# Where it all starts {#sec:start}

This book will try to support readers on any operating system, that is, Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS or Linux.
In the end, the operating system is a tool too; each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

All the operating sytems have one thing in common: the _terminal_[^terminal].

[^terminal]: Actually, most people will use a _terminal emulator_ because most people will use a graphical interface and then open a window *emulating* a terminal.

Subsections:

- Set up terminal with memory; fuzzy search (nope, this is advanced an should be appendix)
- Window management and shortcuts.
