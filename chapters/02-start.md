# Where it all starts

If there is one thing that makes me anticipate an apocalypse, it is the fact that it will make Microsoft Windows dissapear.
That is, of course, a joke, but I mean it.
The problem is that Windows has not been improving much in the last years, whereas many people still use for historic reasons.
Microsoft is now mainly focused on the cloud, and it's mostly running Linux there [@openwall2019oss].
**However, this book will support readers on any operating system**, that is, Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS or Linux.
In the end, the operating system is a tool too; each with their own benefits and drawbacks.

All the operating sytems have one thing in common: the _terminal_[^terminal].

[^terminal]: Actually, I should say _terminal emulator_ because most people will use a graphical interface with a terminal emulator instead of just a terminal.
