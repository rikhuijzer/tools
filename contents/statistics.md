# Predicting the future {#sec:statistics}

Statistics can be separated into algorithms and inference [@efron2016computer].
For example, classifying which mail is spam can be seen as a purely algorithmic problem.
If the algorithm works, then it doesn't really matter to know why it works.
In science, we're more interested in inference, that is, to know why our model works and what we can *infer* from it.
In this chapter, I go respectively into Frequentist and Bayesian statistics using Julia in @sec:freq and @sec:bayes.
For both, extensive documentation is still lacking, so this book can help you in getting started in either one (or both) of the two pardigms.
