## Frequentist {#sec:freq}

After introducing some common statistical notions in the previous sections, we can now focus on linear models and their corresponding statistical tests.
From linear models, it is possible to formulate many common tests, or very close approximations, including Pearson correlations, t-tests and ANOVAs [@lindelov2019common].
Note that linear models are as valid in the Bayesian paradigm as in the frequentist paradigm.
However, here we focus on the combination with the frequentists tests, which is why these models are listed under the frequentist section.

In line with @bishop2006pattern, generally, we can write a linear model $\text{lm}$ as

$$ \text{lm}(X_n, W_{n+1}) = w_0 + w_1 x_1 + ... + w_n x_n, $$

with input variables $X_n$ and weights $W_{n+1}$.
