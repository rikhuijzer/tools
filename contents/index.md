This website shows the book Tools for Science and is also available as [**PDF**](/tools.pdf){target="_blank"}.
It's still a work in progress, but I'm quite sure that it will be finished.
Feel free to browse around a bit and let me know if you have feedback or suggestions.

The source code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/tools){target="_blank"}.
